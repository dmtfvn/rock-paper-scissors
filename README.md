## Rock Paper Scissors

A single-page application, representing the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game in a simple and intuitive, yet beautifully designed user interface. After displaying the outcome of a single round, every win, loss, or tie is saved.

**Note:** Clearing your browser's data, on which the game is played, will result in a deletion of the current score.  
This process **cannot** be undone.

*This project was entirely created by using pure vanilla javascript.*

## The web app can be used on any device - desktop, tablet, or mobile.
